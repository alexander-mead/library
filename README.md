# Library

This is my personal library of python and Fortran. 

To build the Fortran library simply edit the `Makefile` to your compiler of choice and then type `make`. It requires `FFTW3` (http://www.fftw.org/) to install. I have tested most of the library using `gfortran` and some of it using `ifort`.
