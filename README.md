# Library

This is my personal library of Fortran functions. To build it simply edit the `Makefile` to your compiler of choice and then type `make`. It requires `FFTW3` (http://www.fftw.org/) to install. I have tested most of it using `gfortran` and some of it using `ifort`. I provide no guarentees.
